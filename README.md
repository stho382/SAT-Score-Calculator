# SAT-Score-Calculator

This Excel Model has the ability to:

*   Calculate the overall SAT score given the raw scores for any practice test from one place
*   Reverse engineer the overall score and give you one possible combination of raw scores you
    require in each section
*   An interactive dashboard is also included in which you can compare the results of two
    practice tests

## Dependencies

*   Microsoft Excel and Access
*   Must have "Solver" enabled
*   Must enable macros on startup

## What's Included

The first part of the model is the excel sheet named “Userform”. This is where users can choose the
practice test they have done and enter the raw scores for each section of the SAT into the
appropriate textboxes. Once you press “Submit” button on the “Userform” sheet, A box beneath the
button will give you the overall score for that practice test. If there are any mistakes entered into the
textboxes, such as entering text instead of numbers, the model will produce an error message. The
box in which the overall score is presented, is disabled while the user enters the raw scores to
prevent any alteration of the score by the user.
